# Housing Market Analysis

This analysis integrates global and US housing datasets to uncover price trends, affordability challenges, and macroeconomic impacts. Correlation and regression analysis validate strong links between GDP, employment, and housing performance. The insights support both policy decisions and investor strategy.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes global and US-specific housing market data to uncover trends, affordability challenges, macroeconomic relationships, and risk factors affecting the real estate market. Using Excel for cleaning, SQL for analysis, Python for advanced stats, and Power BI for visualization, this portfolio is designed to demonstrate my ability as a data analyst.
